            <h3>What is a Property Dispute ?</h3>
            <p>
              A property dispute arises when two or more parties disagree over
              the ownership, rights, or use of property. These disputes can
              involve land, residential or commercial buildings, or other real
              estate. Common property disputes include boundary issues,
              inheritance conflicts, landlord-tenant disagreements, and breaches
              of contract during property sales.
